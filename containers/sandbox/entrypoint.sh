# allowlist check is ToolRunner Layer 2 on the host (src/kryonsec/purple/allowlist.py).

# KEEP IN SYNC with the host allowlist: tests/test_allowlist.py
# (test_entrypoint_allowlist_in_sync) fails the build when a host-allowlisted
# tool is missing here. Baked scripts (/opt/kryonsec/*.py) are listed by full path.
