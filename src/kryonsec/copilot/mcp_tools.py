"""MCP server wiring for the general agent (v1.1).

Each enabled MCP server from config.toml ([mcp] servers) is an stdio
server: kryonsec starts it, lists its tools, and exposes them to the
LLM agent alongside the built-in tools. A server that fails to start is
skipped with a console notice — it never blocks the chat.

The `mcp` package is a REQUIRED dependency (the setup wizard offers MCP
presets, so a default install must run them), but it is still imported
lazily: sessions with no MCP servers configured pay no import cost. The
ImportError guard only covers broken/partial installs — it is not a
supported "base without mcp" configuration.

Threading model: each server runs on its own daemon thread inside
anyio.run (asyncio backend). Tool executors marshal the call onto that
same loop with asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe — awaiting session
objects on a *different* loop raises "Future attached to a different
loop", so a fresh anyio.run per call (the v1.1 bug) is never done.
