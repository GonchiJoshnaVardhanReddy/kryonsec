## What is Kryonsec?

Kryonsec is a **dual-mode security CLI for one operator** — you. It is not a framework
and not a multi-user SaaS. It is a tool you install on your machine, talk to in a
terminal, and — when you have written authorization — point at a target.

The two modes are deliberately built on opposite philosophies:

| | **Mode A — General Copilot** | **Mode B — Purple Team** |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | A conversational security assistant with real tools (LLM function-calling) | A penetration-testing engine with a fixed 10-state loop |
| Who decides | The LLM decides *when* to call tools | **Plain Python** decides every state transition — the LLM only proposes, never transitions |
| What it touches | Your files, the web, CVE databases, MCP servers | An authorized target, through a gVisor sandbox |
| Where it runs | Linux, WSL, macOS, Windows | **Linux/WSL2 only** — Docker + gVisor required, enforced by `kryonsec doctor` |
| Data visibility | Sanitized post-REPORT engagement summaries only — never raw evidence | Full engagement graph, evidence, and audit chain |

> **Design-of-record:** [`kryonsec-v2.1.1-dual-mode-architecture.md`](kryonsec-v2.1.1-dual-mode-architecture.md)
> is the authoritative spec. v2.1.0 and the fixes draft are kept in the repo for history.

The core principle that shapes everything else:

> **The LLM is creative, so the system around it must be rigid.**

No LLM-driven state transitions. Tool calls are argv lists, never shell strings.
Allowlists, not blocklists. Secrets never leave the machine by default.

## Requirements

| Component | Copilot (Mode A) | Purple Team (Mode B) |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.11+ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Linux / WSL2 | optional | ✅ required (gVisor) |
| Docker | — | ✅ required |
| [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor) `runsc` runtime | — | ✅ required |
| Pinned `kryonsec/sandbox` image | — | ✅ required (pulled by installer) |
| Ollama (local LLM) | optional (recommended) | optional (recommended) |
| OpenAI API key | optional | optional |
| AWS Bedrock API key | optional | optional |
| PostgreSQL | optional (SQLite fallback) | optional (SQLite fallback in v1.1) |

`kryonsec doctor` checks all of this and refuses to start Purple Team if anything is missing.
On apt-based Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Kali) with sudo, the one-line installer sets up
Docker and gVisor for you, and fetches the sandbox image from a registry (a fast
`docker pull`) rather than building it.

---

## Install

### One command (WSL / Linux / macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GonchiJoshnaVardhanReddy/kryon-sec/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer:

1. Installs missing prerequisites (`git`, `curl`) on apt systems
2. Checks for Python 3.11+ (tries `python3.12`, `python3.11`, `python3`)
3. Creates a dedicated virtualenv at `~/.kryonsec/venv`
4. Installs the **latest released version** into it from GitHub
   (`KRYONSEC_VERSION=@main` or `@<sha>` overrides the tag)
5. Adds `~/.kryonsec/venv/bin` to your `PATH` (in `.bashrc`, idempotent)
6. **On Linux (apt + sudo): auto-installs Docker and gVisor (`runsc`) if missing** — no manual prerequisite steps on Ubuntu/Debian/Kali
7. **Fetches the Zone B sandbox image** when Docker is available (Purple Team) — a `docker pull` from `ghcr.io` in the normal case, which is minutes instead of tens of minutes. If the registry is unreachable, the image for this version isn't published yet, or you're offline, it falls back to building locally with live progress output (2+ GB, 30+ min on slow links). Either way it's tagged `kryonsec/sandbox:latest`, which is what `doctor` and the runner look for.
8. Runs `kryonsec setup` — the first-run wizard
9. Runs `kryonsec doctor` so the final state is visible

To skip the sandbox image entirely and do it later:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GonchiJoshnaVardhanReddy/kryon-sec/main/install.sh | KRYONSEC_SKIP_SANDBOX=1 bash
# later — pull (fast):
docker pull ghcr.io/gonchijoshnavardhanreddy/kryonsec-sandbox:latest
docker tag ghcr.io/gonchijoshnavardhanreddy/kryonsec-sandbox:latest kryonsec/sandbox:latest
# or build (slow):
git clone https://github.com/GonchiJoshnaVardhanReddy/kryon-sec.git
cd kryon-sec
docker build --progress=plain -t kryonsec/sandbox -f containers/sandbox/Dockerfile.kali .
```

Sandbox-image environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `KRYONSEC_SANDBOX_IMAGE` | Override the image ref the installer pulls; may carry a `@sha256:<digest>` |
| `KRYONSEC_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | GHCR token — only needed if the repo/image is private (`read:packages`) |
| `KRYONSEC_REGISTRY_USER` | Username for that token (default `kryonsec`) |
| `KRYONSEC_SKIP_SANDBOX=1` | Skip the image fetch/build entirely |

If a build fails partway, already-downloaded layers are cached — re-running the same command resumes where it stopped.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GonchiJoshnaVardhanReddy/kryon-sec/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Windows gets Copilot mode only — Purple Team is gated behind a runtime check and
must never run on the Windows host. Use WSL2 for Mode B.

### From source (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GonchiJoshnaVardhanReddy/kryon-sec.git
cd kryon-sec
pip install -e ".[dev]"
kryonsec setup
```

---

## First-run setup wizard

The first launch without a config starts the wizard automatically (re-run anytime
with `kryonsec setup`). It walks you through:

1. **Pick your LLM provider** — OpenAI, Ollama (local), or AWS Bedrock
2. **Provider setup**
   - *OpenAI:* paste your API key → it is tested live → pick a model from the list (most recent first)
   - *Ollama:* pick from your already-pulled local models
   - *AWS Bedrock:* paste a Bedrock API key (starts with `ABSK`) → the wizard
     prints how to create one. Your **region is detected automatically** — a
     Bedrock API key carries no region, so the wizard probes the AWS regions
     with your key and remembers the one that accepts it (this is also the key
     check). Then pick a model from the list, cross-region inference profiles
     first — newer Claude models only work through those.
3. **Pick the built-in agent tools** (space to select, enter to continue)
4. **Pick MCP servers** — presets or add your own (see [MCP integration](#mcp-integration))
5. **A summary screen** of everything you chose

The wizard writes `~/.kryonsec/config.toml` with **owner-only permissions** — that
file holds your API key. Environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, `AWS_REGION_NAME`, `DATABASE_URL`,
`OLLAMA_HOST`, `KRYONSEC_HOME`, `KRYONSEC_WORKSPACE`) still override the file for
power users and CI.

---

## Mode A — General Copilot

```bash
kryonsec                  # start the chat
kryonsec doctor           # preflight checks
kryonsec setup            # re-run the wizard
```

### The agent

The copilot is a real tool-using agent (LLM function-calling), not a chat wrapper.
It decides when to call tools, up to 8 tool rounds per answer, then must produce
text. You see every tool call as it happens:

```
[COPILOT]> is CVE-2024-3094 relevant to my nginx setup?
  └─ cve_lookup(cve_id=CVE-2024-3094)
  └─ file_read(path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf)
Yes — here's what matters for your config...
```

Built-in tools the agent can call (only the ones you enabled in setup):

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `file_read` | read a file — **approval-gated** outside `~/kryonsec/workspace` |
| `file_write` | write a file — **approval-gated** outside the workspace |
| `list_dir` | list a directory — **approval-gated** outside the workspace |
| `web_search` | keyless multi-engine web search, results enter chat context |
| `cve_lookup` | NVD CVE lookup, cached locally for offline reuse |

Every file action outside the workspace shows a yellow approval panel — why the
agent wants the file, and Approve/Deny. **Deny is the default (Enter = Deny).**

### Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/cve CVE-2024-1234` | CVE lookup from NVD, cached offline |
| `/search <query>` | web search — results go into context |
| `/read <path>` | read a file (approval-gated outside workspace) |
| `/ls <path>` | list a directory (approval-gated outside workspace) |
| `/write <path>` | write text to a file in the workspace |
| `/workspace` | show the workspace path |
| `/mode` | switch copilot ⇄ purple mode — or press **Shift+Tab** |
| `/help` | command reference |
| `/quit` (`exit`, `quit`, `q`) | leave — session is persisted |

### Memory

- **Session STM:** messages are kept and compacted when they exceed 80% of the
  token budget — compaction runs with secrets redacted, and a broken compaction
  model skips itself rather than killing your chat mid-turn.
- **Long-term memory:** after each exchange, a background pass extracts durable
  facts about you (role, preferences, ongoing projects) into `general_user_ltm`
  — best-effort by design; memory failure never breaks the chat.
- **Long-term memory is isolated:** the copilot can see *sanitized post-REPORT
  engagement summaries* only. It never sees raw evidence, credentials, or live
  engagement data (see [safety design](#safety-design)).

### Web search

`/search` (and the agent's `web_search` tool) tries five keyless sources in
order — DuckDuckGo html/lite/API, Mojeek, Wikipedia — so it keeps working when
one engine bot-challenges your network. Results are cached for a day.

### MCP integration

Copilot is an MCP client. During setup you can enable servers (stdio transport,
one subprocess per server, connected once per session — not per message):

| Preset | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch` | `uvx mcp-server-fetch` | fetch web pages as clean text, no API key |
| `filesystem` | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` | needs Node; wizard asks for the allowed directory |

You can also add any custom stdio MCP server (name + command + env). Every MCP
tool the server exposes becomes a tool the agent can call.

---

## Mode B — Purple Team

One command runs a full engagement:

```bash
kryonsec purple --target your-authorized-target.com
# or: kryonsec purple --target example.com --id my-engagement
# with blue-team code scanning (folder mounted read-only into the sandbox):
kryonsec purple --target example.com --code /path/to/source
```

Or switch inside the chat with `/mode` (or **Shift+Tab**), then type a domain.

> ⚠️ **Only run this against systems you are authorized to test.**

### The 10-state loop

The engine walks a fixed state machine — **no LLM-driven transitions, ever**:

| # | State | Agent | What it does | Zone |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `INIT` | init | load config, validate scope | — |
| 2 | `RECON_PASSIVE` | passive-recon | third-party lookups — **zero packets to target** (crt.sh + issuer/validity, Wayback, OTX, RIPEstat, Shodan, Censys, RDAP WHOIS, GitHub recon, HackerTarget DNS history, cloud-asset analysis; subfinder/amass/assetfinder `-passive` in sandbox) | A + B (passive) |
| 3 | `RECON_ACTIVE` | active-recon | scan the target — nmap, naabu, rustscan, dnsx, httpx, whatweb, katana, hakrawler, feroxbuster, sslscan, testssl.sh, openapi_probe (API discovery), gowitness (screenshots → `/evidence`) | B (sandbox) |
| 4 | `HYPOTHESIZE` | hypothesizer (LLM) | **propose** hypotheses from recon data, then enrich with NVD/CPE/CWE, CISA KEV, EPSS, OSV, GitHub Advisory + sandboxed searchsploit and nuclei-template lookup | A + B |
| 5 | `HUMAN_REVIEW` | operator (you) | **approve or reject each hypothesis** — blocking gate | — |
| 6 | `EXPLOIT` | exploit | execute **approved hypotheses only** — sqlmap, nuclei, nikto, ffuf, gobuster, wfuzz, curl, wget, dalfox, commix, ssrfmap, arjun, tplmap, jwt_tool, kiterunner, graphql-cop | B (sandbox) |
| 7 | `POST_EXPLOIT` | post-exploit | evidence collection in an obtained shell — needs **separate approval** (dormant: no current tool yields a shell; impacket/bloodhound allowlisted for when one does) | B (sandbox) |
| 8 | `VERIFY` | verifier | **independently confirm** findings — curl, http, dig, nc, ncat, openssl, baked probe script | B (sandbox) |
| 9 | `BLUE_TEAM` | blue-team (LLM) | fixes + detection rules, grounded in scanner evidence with `--code` (semgrep, bandit, gitleaks, trivy, checkov, hadolint, syft, osv-scanner, grype on a read-only `/code` mount) | B (scanners) + LLM |
| 10 | `REPORT` | reporter | compile the engagement report (Jinja2) with enrichment, CVSS scores, timeline, dedup | — |
| — | `HALT` | — | terminal absorbing state | — |

Deterministic transition table (plain Python in `purple/orchestrator.py`):

- `HUMAN_REVIEW` with **zero approvals** → routes through `BLUE_TEAM` (v2.1.1 fix:
  rejection still produces defensive recommendations, never jumps straight to REPORT)
- `EXPLOIT` → `POST_EXPLOIT` only if a shell was obtained *and* post-exploit was
  separately approved; otherwise → `VERIFY`
- `REPORT` → `HALT`, always

A **budget tracker** (tokens / wall-clock / cost) halts the loop when exhausted —
the same guard that refuses to leave `INIT` when the Profile-2 prerequisites
(Linux + Docker + gVisor) are missing.

### The evidence ladder

Findings are never just "the scanner said so." Each climbs a three-rung ladder:

| Rung | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **tested** | a tool ran against the target |
| **confirmed** | the exploit tool reported the finding |
| **verified** | an **independent second tool** (e.g. curl boolean probes) agreed with the finding |

Only **verified** findings are reported as such. The generated report includes
repeatable test steps in plain words so a human tester can re-check every finding
by hand.

### Zones

- **Zone A (host):** passive recon and enrichment run host-side using only
  third-party APIs (crt.sh certificates + issuer/validity, Wayback Machine
  archives, OTX passive DNS, RIPEstat whois/ASN, NVD, CISA KEV, EPSS, OSV,
  GitHub Advisory, Shodan and Censys with keys, RDAP WHOIS via the IANA
  bootstrap, GitHub recon with an optional token, HackerTarget DNS history).
  **Zero packets to the target.** API keys are injected per-call and never
  logged.
- **Zone B (sandbox):** all active tool execution happens inside a Kali-based
  Docker container under the **gVisor `runsc` runtime**, with a seccomp profile,
  a **non-root** user, and a read-only root filesystem. The sandbox image is
  pinned by digest. With `--code`, your source folder is mounted **read-only**
  at a fixed `/code` path for the static analyzers. Screenshots (gowitness) go
  to a read-write `/evidence` mount — the only one — landing under
  `~/.kryonsec/engagements/<id>/evidence/`.

### Enrichment and the report

Hypotheses that name a CVE get public-risk context automatically: NVD
score/CPE/CWE, CISA KEV (actively-exploited list), EPSS (probability of
exploitation), OSV and GitHub Advisory severity + affected packages, whether
public exploit code exists (searchsploit in the sandbox), and matching nuclei
templates. The engagement report shows all of it, plus a CVSS 3.1 base score
calculated locally from each hypothesis's vector, a timeline built from the
audit chain, deduplicated findings, and normalized evidence — with a
tamper-evident fingerprint of the audit chain. With `--code`, the report also
has a "Code scanning results" section with an SBOM summary (syft) and one row
per scanner.

### The audit chain

Every step is appended to a **tamper-evident audit log**: append-only JSONL,
SHA256-chained records, hashes computed over canonical JSON (sorted keys, tight
separators) — the same serialization written to disk. The chain head hash is
printed at the end of every engagement and can be anchored periodically (WORM
object + stdout).

### End of engagement

The summary screen gives you a one-line verdict first (halted / verified findings /
possible-but-unverified / nothing confirmed), then the evidence sections:
subdomains found, hypotheses with confidence scores, tool runs with exit codes,
findings with their verified status, the audit chain head, and the report path
(`~/.kryonsec/engagements/<id>/report.md`).

If the sandbox isn't available, the engagement still runs — it stops after
passive recon, because Zone A works everywhere.

---

## Safety design

Ten safety layers from the v2.1.1 spec, all implemented and unit-tested:

1. **No LLM-driven state transitions** — the orchestrator is plain Python with a
   deterministic transition table.
2. **Allowlists, not blocklists** — ToolRunner validates every argv against
   per-tool templates; anything outside the template is rejected. E.g. `nmap`
   may only be `-Pn -sT -sV -sC --max-rate {rate} -p {ports} {target}`.
3. **argv lists, never shell strings** — tools receive container arguments, not
   shell-interpreted text. There is no `shell=True` anywhere in the tool path.
4. **Secrets never leave the machine by default** — secrets are
   redacted-and-tokenized (`«SECRET_n»`) before any LLM call; compaction with
   secrets present always routes to local Ollama, never a third-party API.
   Engagement data, credentials, and raw evidence are never sent to third-party LLMs.
5. **RECON_PASSIVE sends zero packets to the target** — host-side Zone A only.
6. **Zone B egress is target-scope only** (via the egress proxy, pending —
   containers use the default bridge today and the gap is audited), sandbox
   image pinned by digest.
7. **No docker.sock in the kryonsec container** — Docker access goes through a
   socket proxy with endpoint allowlisting.
8. **Audit chain** — append-only JSONL, SHA256-linked, canonical-JSON hashed.
9. **Purple Team is Linux-only** — `kryonsec doctor` checks Docker, the `runsc`
   runtime, and the pinned sandbox image, and refuses to start Mode B otherwise.
10. **Mode isolation** — general mode reads only sanitized post-REPORT summaries
    from `ltm_engagement_summaries`; live engagement data is invisible to it.

Plus, in Copilot mode: every file action outside the workspace requires explicit
approval (deny by default), and tool output is size-bounded
(`max_tool_output_chars`).

---

## Configuration reference

Config lives at `~/.kryonsec/config.toml` (override the directory with
`KRYONSEC_HOME`). Written by the wizard; hand-editable.

```toml
[llm]
provider = "openai"                  # "openai" | "ollama" | "bedrock"
chat_model = "ollama/llama3.1"       # main copilot model
search_model = "gpt-4o-mini"         # fact-extraction / light calls
compaction_model = "gpt-4o-mini"     # chat compaction (local when secrets)
local_model = "ollama/llama3.1"      # fallback + secrets-present routing
openai_api_key = "sk-..."
ollama_host = "http://localhost:11434"
bedrock_api_key = "ABSK..."          # AWS Bedrock key (also AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK)
bedrock_region = "us-east-1"         # detected by the wizard (also AWS_REGION_NAME)

[session]
max_session_tokens = 16000
compaction_trigger_ratio = 0.8
compaction_keep_tokens = 8000
max_messages = 50

[limits]
max_tool_output_chars = 20000

[sandbox]
image = "kryonsec/sandbox:latest"    # or kryonsec/sandbox@sha256:<digest>

[tools]
enabled = ["file_read", "file_write", "web_search", "cve_lookup"]

[[mcp.servers]]
name = "fetch"
command = "uvx mcp-server-fetch"
env = "{}"
```

Environment variables (they win over TOML): `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`,
`OLLAMA_HOST`, `KRYONSEC_HOME`, `KRYONSEC_WORKSPACE`, `KRYONSEC_SANDBOX_IMAGE`,
`KRYONSEC_VERSION` (installer).

### LLM backends

All LLM calls route through **LiteLLM** with a fallback chain:

1. **Ollama (local, preferred):** `ollama serve` + `ollama pull llama3.1` — nothing leaves your machine
2. **OpenAI:** API key from the wizard or `OPENAI_API_KEY` — used for chat and
   light analysis, but **never** for compaction when secrets are present (those
   calls always route locally)
3. **AWS Bedrock:** a Bedrock API key (wizard, or `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`).
   Same rule as OpenAI — Bedrock is a third party, so secrets are never sent
   to it. Model ids carry a `bedrock/` prefix, e.g.
   `bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0`

The wizard's provider choice is exclusive: an Ollama config never calls a hosted
API, and an OpenAI or Bedrock config never silently falls back to a different
provider — only the local model, and only for the secrets gate.

---

## Storage schema

SQLAlchemy models (`src/kryonsec/storage/models.py`). PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`
is the system of record; without it, kryonsec falls back to an embedded SQLite DB
(`~/.kryonsec/kryonsec.db`) for Copilot-mode memory.

| Table | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `general_sessions` | A | persisted chat sessions |
| `general_user_ltm` | A | long-term facts + preferences about the user |
| `system_knowledge` | A | system-level knowledge |
| `stm_nodes` | B | engagement graph nodes (subdomains, hypotheses, attempts, findings) |
| `ltm_target_profiles` | B | per-target knowledge across engagements |
| `ltm_engagement_summaries` | B | sanitized summaries — the only engagement data Mode A can read |
| `engagement_secret_map` | B | `«SECRET_n»` → secret mappings for an engagement |
| `checkpoints` | B | engagement checkpoints |

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

- **Python 3.11+**, type hints everywhere, **Pydantic v2** for structured data
- LLM calls go through **LiteLLM only** (`litellm.completion`)
- Database access through a thin repository layer (`kryonsec/storage/`)
- Prompts and reports are **Jinja2 templates** in `kryonsec/templates/`
- **Every safety layer has at least one unit test** — 594 tests across 31 files
  covering the audit chain, allowlist, secrets redaction, orchestrator
  transitions, compaction, sandbox, enrichment, scanners, report validation,
  CVSS calculator, TUI, wizard, and more

Optional extras: `pip install -e ".[postgres]"` for the PostgreSQL driver
(`psycopg[binary]`, v3). A plain `postgresql://…` `DATABASE_URL` is pointed at
whichever psycopg is installed; write `postgresql+psycopg2://` yourself if you
specifically want psycopg2.

Dev note: since v1.1 config comes from `~/.kryonsec/config.toml` (the old `.env`
loading is gone). Run `kryonsec setup` once, or export `OPENAI_API_KEY` for a
quick start.

### Sandbox smoke test (Linux / WSL2)

```bash
kryonsec doctor                    # must pass: docker, runsc, pinned image
kryonsec purple --target example.com --code ~/src/my-app
```

Watch the BLUE_TEAM state in the run output — it should report the
scanners that ran (semgrep/bandit/gitleaks/trivy/checkov/syft/osv-scanner/
grype, plus hadolint when the folder has a Dockerfile), and the report's
fix list should be grounded in that scanner evidence. The report also gets
an SBOM summary line and a timeline table. After the first run on a new
version, fetch the new sandbox image (new tools are baked in):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gonchijoshnavardhanreddy/kryonsec-sandbox:latest
docker tag ghcr.io/gonchijoshnavardhanreddy/kryonsec-sandbox:latest kryonsec/sandbox:latest
# or, from a source checkout:
docker build -t kryonsec/sandbox -f containers/sandbox/Dockerfile.kali .
```

### Publishing a release (maintainer)

The sandbox image is published to GHCR by
`.github/workflows/sandbox-image.yml`, so users pull instead of building.

1. **One-time repo setup:** Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions →
   *Read and write permissions*. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push packages
   without this. (For a private repo, also make the package private under
   Packages → `kryonsec-sandbox` → Settings.)
2. **First image:** the workflow can't retro-publish for tags that predate it.
   Run it once by hand: Actions → *sandbox-image* → *Run workflow* on `main`.
3. **Every release:** tag and push (`git tag v1.3.2 && git push --tags`). The
   workflow builds and pushes `:v1.3.2` plus `:latest` (non-prerelease tags only).
4. **Read the digest** off the run's job summary — it prints
   `ghcr.io/gonchijoshnavardhanreddy/kryonsec-sandbox@sha256:<digest>`.
5. **Optionally pin it** in `src/kryonsec/config.py` (`sandbox_image`) so
   `doctor`/runner verify the exact bytes this release was tested against, per
   spec §8.6. Pinning is a deliberate per-release choice: the installer retags
   the pulled image as `kryonsec/sandbox:latest`, so a digest-pinned default
   only works for users who pull that digest. Leaving the tag default keeps
   offline rebuilds working; users who want strict pinning set
   `KRYONSEC_SANDBOX_IMAGE` to the digest ref.
6. **Verify** on a clean machine: `docker pull` the new tag, then
   `kryonsec doctor` must pass.
